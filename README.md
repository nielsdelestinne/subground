# Subground

A Dungeon Crawler game

## Install
1. Run `yarn install` or simply `yarn` from inside the project's root to install the required dependencies

## Run
1. Run `yarn run build` to compile the code and create an archive (bundled `bundle.js` file in the `dist` folder) 

## Technicalities
1. **Typescript**
    - It is compiled back into ES5
2. **Yarn** is used to manage the external dependencies
3. **Webpack** is used to bundle the modules (into a single minified file)
    - In essence it handles the internal dependencies among all the files
